## Welcome!
Hi, this is my repository which gives information about the UniMelb undegraduate Data Science major.    
The official handbook for the Data Science major can be [viewed here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2019/components/b-sci-major-8).

#### Akira's First Law of Code
*Let `E = errors`, `M = more`, `C = code`. Then the equation `E = MC^2` holds true for all `E > 0` as `E` must be positive definite in any code written.*

If you're from COMP20003 (or any subject that uses the C language), I have written [this guide](https://github.com/akiratwang/COMP20003) for setting up your Windows 10 device for WSL2 - Ubuntu-20.04LTS. As for those interested in installing an Anaconda distribution for Jupyter Notebooks, refer to [this old guide from 2017](https://github.com/akiratwang/Sept2017_PandasWorkshop/blob/master/Python_installation.md)

For a (very very) neat timetable planner for university, visit my mate Rohyl's [lookahead](https://lookahead.rohyl.io/) which has the cleanest interface ever and has saved me numerous time for sorting out my timetable.

### Core Math Subjects:
There's a lot more maths than you think (the major shares the same core maths as Actuarial Science up to second year), and so I highly recommend you take either AM1 / AM2 or Real Analysis, or else Probability will be a hard grind to do well in.

- Science and Internship Program (SCIE30002)

### My chosen Breadths:
- Japanese 3 (JAPN10007)
- Music in the Culture of the Renaissance (MUSI30011)
- High Baroque Music of the German World (MUSI30014)
- Music Health (MUSI20150)
- Positive Leadership and Careers (EDUC30072)

## Subject Reviews (Pooled from a variety of opinions)
**Foundations of Computing**:  
- Subject is run well both semesters and is a great introduction to Python and Computer Science.
- Great for students who have little or no background in "tech" or "programming"
- Not crammable. If you want to do well, you have to consistently grind and practice it (like maths).
- Consider doing it if you're interested in programming (and it's a better alternative to ENG COMP).

**Foundations of Algorithms**:  
- Introduction to basic sorting algorithms and the C programming language (ha ha ha C code go brrrr).
- Makes you appreciate memory management in Python because of `malloc` (though `calloc` is better imo).
- Tutors are amazing and can actually teach. (**Shout out to my tutor Alex Zable**).
- Learn to use `valgrind` if you don't want `Segmentation Faults`, and `gdb` to avoid debugging nightmares.

**Elements of Data Processing**:  
- *I personally think this subject is worth taking regardless of what you've heard. Real world data is much worse and there's no one telling you what to do. If you went to get better at this kind of stuff, suss out kaggle datasets and perform your own data cleaning and analysis*
- Teaches the concepts of ETL (Extract, Transform and Load), data processing and basic privacy concerns around data via Python (Jupyter Notebooks).
- You'll find that a lot of the fun stuff (such as ML and research) need to have a good ETL pipeline setup in order for it to be efficient and working.

**Database Systems**:
- *I just want to say that this is one of the most useful subjects I have taken in undergrad. I'm using a decent chunk of SQL (Microsoft SQL Server or IPython-sql library) for my work and the material I learned from this subject has come in handy*
- The theory content is quite useful, but the concepts taught are very applicable in industry.
- 1st assignment is a bit iffy since it's a conceptual diagram of an ER-Model, but holy heck do I wish I payed more attention and put more effort in it as industry projects rely heavily on "good concepts".
- The stuff you learn here will help you for ML, AI, and any Data Science or Data Analytics position.

**Algorithm Data Structures**:
- By far the best 2nd year CIS subject ever (better alternative to Design of Algorithms).
- Goes through all the great algorithms, _including_ path-finding algorithms (unlike DoA which covers hashing and compression instead).
  - For example, the second assignment is usually on path finding and very basic artificial intelligence implementations to solve a `15 puzzle` or to even play `pacman`!
- Assignments are great fun, and after FoA you should (hopefully) be experienced enough in C to appreciate it.
- If you're rusty on C don't worry as the first few lectures are revision (we recover `malloc` as well for eng comp kids).
- The 2018 Exam question about electrical outages landed me a Graduate offer at EssentialEnergy (ayyyy).
- *Students who never had to experience dimefox / nutmeg gonna hate and not appreciate. JupyterHub is so good compared to dimefox and nutmeg servers.*
- *I want to add on by saying you guys are super lucky, JupyterHub has only recently become a more commercially used way of showing visualizations and running code on the cloud and you people have first hand experience of it!*

**Artificial Intelligence**:
- First third of the lectures are review of basic search algorithms (ADS students will find it a breeze).
- Assignments **ARE AMAZINGLY FUN**.
- Hard and conceptual tutorial questions (although there is no full solution) but are quite useful in expanding your problem solving.
- Notation for Probability (YES PROB IS IN THE SUBJECT) uses logical AND/OR/NOT, so you have been warned.
- If you loved ADS or DoA, you'll love this even more (and it's beneficial to both ML and Applied Data Science).

**Machine Learning:**
- Subject has no maths pre-req, but they did try to attempt to cover "Linear Statistical Models" in 1 lecture `:thinking:`.
- A wide variety of models are covered at a high level.
- Overall the subject content felt a bit ambitious given that the maths was not pre-req (notably probability for Naive Bayes).
- First assignment is a joke if you have done probability, but the second is a **lot more** interesting (usually NLP in nature).
- 2019 Comment: Tim Baldwin snaked us for Exam Section D rip marks.

**Applied Data Science (Capstone Project):**
- A very informative subject to make an overall great learning experience
- Project is very fun and enjoyable if you love applying different techniques you've learnt over the previous subjects.
- Group project is very dependent on how good your team works together, so find peers that have a similar work ethic as you!
- The **only** subject IMO (apart from IT Project) where you can put as little or as much time as you want. 
- This is probably the only subject in undergrad Data Science where you have the freedom to use whatever to solve industry problems.

**Maths Subjects**:
- They're all well run
- Probability is a big jump (if you didn't do Real Analysis or AM1/AM2) so prepare to grind.
- Yao-Ban is the best lecturer (you'll have him for LSM).

## Final Tips
- I highly recommend you go learn LaTeX, which can be easily done through www.overleaf.com. Not only does it make your assignments look amazing, it's a great way of making great notes and reports (which employers love).
- DO try your best, but WAM isn't everything (I have a WAM in the 70s) and anything above a 65+ will land you a job provided you network and apply yourself well.
- Try to do projects outside of university. A lot of job offers were as a result of several projects I completed outside of University.
- Be active in your tutorial and labs! It helps the tutor **A LOT** and will help you learn better.
- **My plea: Honestly, people who think sharepoints with excel spreadsheets are "databases" should just end themselves. Become a good Database admin - document and normalize your work, make it easier for everyone else please.**

## So why Data Science?
It's actually just statistics rebranded with computer science. You're essentially combining the brains of a statistician with the brawn of computing power. If you love working with data (ethical or non-ethical) or a keen to analyze things, Data Science is definitely a great field to go into.
